My project is a Single Page Application(SAP), written using ReactJs Library.  I used axios as an HTTP client to fetch data via PetFinder APIS. For Design Layout I used Bootstrap(Carousel, Icons, Cards).

The main idea of this project is to find homes for Dogs in shelter.

As an animal lover, anyone can create good karma by doing the right thing and by saving a life. You could buy a bred-to-order puppy or dog from a breeder or a pet shop, but instead you are deciding to help tackle the problem of pet overpopulation by giving a rescued pet a home.

My goal for “Happy Doggy” is to find each and every pet the perfect home — with an adopter that thinks of them as their reward for the good they’ve done in their lives.
