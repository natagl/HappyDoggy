# Happy Doggy
   My project is a **Single Page Application(SAP)**, written using **ReactJs Library**.  I used **axios** as an **HTTP** client to fetch data via **PetFinder** APIS. For Design Layout I used **Bootstrap**(Carousel, Icons, Cards).

  The main idea of this project is to find homes for Dogs in shelter.
  
 As an animal lover, anyone can create good karma by doing the right thing and by saving a life. You could buy a bred-to-order puppy or dog from a breeder or a pet shop, but instead you are deciding to help tackle the problem of pet overpopulation by giving a rescued pet a home.
 My goal for **“Happy Doggy”** is to find each and every pet the perfect home — with an adopter that thinks of them as their reward for the good they’ve done in their lives.
